You are a knowledge engineering assistant tasked with creating a new ontology property that connects two classes directly, following the Object Property Chain Shortcutting pattern.

Given:

- Class A (A_label): ${A_label}
  - Property p (p_label): ${p_label}
    - Domain: ${A_label}
    - Range: ${B_label}

- Class B (B_label): ${B_label}
  - Property r (r_label): ${r_label}
    - Domain: ${B_label}
    - Range: ${C_label}

- Class C (C_label): ${C_label}

Goal:

- Create a new property q that directly connects Class A (${A_label}) to Class C (${C_label}), effectively shortcutting the path through Class B (${B_label}).

Instructions:

1. **Understand the Existing Relationships:**
   - A ${A_label} is associated with ${B_label} via ${p_label}.
   - ${B_label} is associated with ${C_label} via ${r_label}.
   - Therefore, a ${A_label} is associated with ${C_label} through the intermediary ${B_label}.

2. **Apply the Object Property Chain Shortcutting Pattern:**
   - **Objective:** Introduce a new property that captures the transitive relationship between ${A_label} and ${C_label}.
   - **Semantic Meaning:** The new property should reflect the idea that a ${A_label} directly relates to a ${C_label}.

3. **Create the New Property:**
   - **Name Suggestion:** Propose a concise and semantically appropriate name for the new property q.
   - **Domain and Range:**
     - **Domain:** ${A_label}
     - **Range:** ${C_label}
   - **Property Characteristics:**
     - Should accurately represent the direct relationship between ${A_label} and ${C_label}.
     - Must align with ontology design best practices and naming conventions.

4. **Provide the Following in Your Response:**
   - **Suggested Property Name:** The name of the new property q.
   - **Explanation:** A brief justification for the chosen property name, explaining how it captures the intended relationship.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the property name is clear, unambiguous, and intuitively understandable by users of the ontology.
- Avoid using overly technical language or jargon in the property name.
- The property should facilitate more efficient querying and better visualization within the ontology.

** JSON Output Format **

Please provide your final answer in **valid JSON** format **only**, with the structure:
{"property_name": "<Your suggested property name>", "explanation": "<A short explanation describing the reasoning or meaning of the property>"}
