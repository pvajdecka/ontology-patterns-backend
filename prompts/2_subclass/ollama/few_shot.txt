You are a knowledge engineering assistant tasked with creating a new ontology class that would be a subclass of Class A (${A_label}), following the Subclass Enrichment pattern.

**Examples of desired outputs:**

Now, given the following input:

- Class A (${A_label}):
  - Property p (${p_label}):
    - Domain: ${A_label}
    - Range: ${B_label}

- Class B (${B_label})

- Class C (${C_label}), a subclass of ${B_label}

**Goal:**

- Suggest a new class that would be a subclass of ${A_label}, where instances are those that have a ${p_label} relationship to instances of ${C_label}.

**Instructions:**

1. **Understand the Existing Relationships:**
   - A ${A_label} has a ${p_label} relationship to a ${B_label}.
   - ${C_label} is a subclass of ${B_label}, meaning every ${C_label} is also a ${B_label}.

2. **Apply the Subclass Enrichment Pattern:**
   - **Objective:** Introduce a new subclass of ${A_label} that represents ${A_label} instances connected via ${p_label} to ${C_label} instances.
   - **Semantic Meaning:** The new class should capture the concept of ${A_label} instances specifically related to ${C_label} instances.

3. **Create the New Class:**
   - **Name Suggestion:** Propose a concise and semantically appropriate name for the new subclass.

4. **Provide the Following in Your Response:**
   - **Suggested Class Name:** The name of the new subclass.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the class name is clear, unambiguous, and intuitively understandable by users of the ontology.
- Avoid using overly technical language or jargon in the class name.
- The new class should facilitate more efficient querying and better organization within the ontology.
- Provide short explanation of new generated ontology class
